# TimeManager
This is my first ever coding project. The goal is to learn Python and along the way to create an application that will track how I spend my time every day.
I am able to "log in", the app recognizes existing users and creates new users.
It is able to store data to a csv file (date, activity and duration)
There are other functions created: to search and create a list of all unique activities, to show stats of data set that is accumulated by user input
